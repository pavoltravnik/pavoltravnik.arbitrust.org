The costs of a classic state court proceeding depend on:

- the complexity of the dispute,
- number of parties,
- number of court proceedings with attendance,
- whether you appeal
- costs of your attorney
- and many more...

## State court

From my personal experience, you can expect costs to be around 2.000 EUR for representation and court fees. Due to the number of instances, the court may exceed this budget by ten times. I dare not say where the limit is in complex and complicated legal proceedings. Legal representation in more complex cases can cost 15.000 EUR and even much more.

## Private arbitration

Costs of arbitration on the other hand depend on your primary choice of private court or arbitrator. It really depends on the qualification and reputation of the court and the person you appoint to decide a dispute.

**Viena International Arbitral Center** offers arbitrage from [5,200 EUR](https://www.viac.eu/en/arbitration/cost-calculator).

Czech arbitration court offers arbitrage from around [400 EUR](https://www.soud.cz/sazebniky). (11.000 CZK)

I offer my service to be Ad hoc Arbiter for 300 EUR. I believe that arbitration should be swift and even people not educated in law should properly understand a decision.

## Conclusion

I am proposing private arbitration because I strongly believe it is a future for civil disputes. It is an efficient, time-saving, and inexpensive solution for solving disagreements from past contracts. If you are not going to choose me as an arbitrator, it is fine. Choose your preferred arbitrator and save money and time. Both are precious.
